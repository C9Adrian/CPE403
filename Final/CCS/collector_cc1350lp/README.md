TI 15.4-Stack Collector Example
==========================

Example Summary
---------------

The collector example application demonstrates how to implement a Personal Area Network (PAN) Coordinator device using TI 15.4-Stack. A TI 15.4-Stack based star network consists of two types of logical devices: the PAN-Coordinator and the network devices, e.g. the Collector and Sensor applications, respectively.

The PAN-Coordinator is the device that starts the network and allows for other devices to join the network. The network devices join the network through and always communicate with the PAN-Coordinator.

The example applications in TI 15.4-Stack are developed for the CC13x0 Launchpad platform. In addition, the Linux example applications for the external host (AM335x + MAC Coprocessor) are located in the [**TI 15.4-Stack Gateway SDK**](http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-15.4-stack-gateway-linux-sdk).

> The project names for CC1310 and C1350 platforms are referred to as CC13x0. Replace x with either **1** or **5** depending on the specific wireless MCU being used.

Peripherals Exercised
---------------------

* `Board_LED0` - Set when the collector application is initialized. Flashes when the network is open for joining.
* `Board_BUTTON0` - Press to initialize the collector application.
> If the **AUTO_START** symbol is defined in your application, then the application will automatically configure itself on startup.
* `Board_BUTTON1` - Press to allow new devices to join the network. While the network is open for joining, `Board_LED0` will flash. Press again to disallow joining.

Resources & Jumper Settings
---------------------------
The following hardware is required to run TI 15.4-Stack Out of Box (OOB) example applications:
* Two [**CC13x0 Launchpad development kits**](http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc1310)
* Optional - Two [**LCD Boosterpack modules**](http://www.ti.com/tool/430boost-sharp96)


> If you're using an IDE (such as CCS or IAR), please refer to `Board.html` in
your project directory for resources used and board-specific jumper settings.
Otherwise, you can find `Board.html` in the directory
&lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/source/ti/boards/&lt;BOARD&gt;.

Example Usage
-------------
This example project implements a collector device: the PAN-Coordinator for the network. This device creates a TI 15.4-Stack network, allows sensor devices to join the network, collects sensor information sent by devices running the sensor example application, and tracks if the devices are on the network or not by periodically sending tracking request messages.

This example assumes a second Launchpad is running the default sensor application code.

The example output can either be viewed by connecting the optional LCD Boosterpack, or through the UART terminal.

* Open a serial session (e.g. [`PuTTY`](http://www.putty.org/ "PuTTY's
Homepage"), etc.) to the appropriate COM port with the following settings.

> The COM port can be determined via Device Manager in Windows or via
`ls /dev/tty*` in Linux.


* Upon example start, the connection will have the following settings:
```
    Baud-rate:     115200
    Data bits:          8
    Stop bits:          1
    Parity:          None
    Flow Control:    None
```
and initially display the following text on either the optional LCD or UART terminal.
```
    TI Collector
    Waiting... (If AUTO_START is defined)
```

* Start the application by pressing `Board_BUTTON0` and collector specific application information will be displayed, such as the channel number.
```
    Starting...
    Started
    Channel: 0
```

* Open the network to allow network devices to join by pressing `Board_BUTTON1`. If using the default Sensor application as a network device the following will be displayed when data is ready:
```
    PermitJoin-ON
    Joined: 0x01
    ConfigRsp: 0x01
    Sensor 0x1
```

> In order for the network device to join, it must have either the generic PAN Id (0xFFFF, default configuration) or the same PAN Id as the collector. These settings can be found in the application's `config.h` file.

Analyzing Network Traffic 
-------------------------

TI 15.4-Stack provides the means to analyze over-the-air traffic by including a packet sniffer firmware image. With an additional CC13x0 Launchpad, users can set up a packet sniffer with the software provided in the SDK. More information about this can be found in the TI 15.4-Stack documentation under **Packet Sniffer**.


Application Design Details
--------------------------

See `config.h` and `features.h` for the default application settings. Some important settings in config.h include:

* `CONFIG_SECURE` - enables/disables MAC security. Default is **enabled**
* `CONFIG_FH_ENABLE` - enables/diables Frequency Hopping mode. Default is **diabled**
* `CONFIG_CHANNEL_MASK` - sets the active scanning channels mask. Default is **channels 0-3**
* `CONFIG_BEACON_ORDER` - sets beacon order for beacon/non-beacon mode. 0-14 are for beacon mode and 15 is for non-beacon mode. Default is **15** (non-beacon mode)
* `CONFIG_SUPERFRAME_ORDER` - sets superframe order for beacon/non-beacon mode. 0-14 are for beacon mode and 15 is for non-beacon mode. Default is **15** (non-beacon mode)

> The `features.h` file can be modified in order to disable certain features to **save code space**.

More information about the configuration and feature options can be found in the TI 15.4-Stack documentation under **Example Applications > Configuration Parameters**.

A detailed description of the application architecture can be found in your installation within the
TI-15.4 Stack Getting Started Guide's Application Overview section.

> For IAR users:
When using the CC13x0DK, the TI XDS110v3 USB Emulator must
be selected. For the CC13x0_LAUNCHXL, select TI XDS110 Emulator. In both cases,
select the cJTAG interface.

In order to build from flash, within the IAR Project options-> Build Actions
Update the "Pre-build command line" and change the "NO_ROM=0" to "NO_ROM=1".
